# NOSLib
 NOS is a sound reactive visual performance tool developed and used by NOS Visuals (www.nosvisuals.com).
 
NOS is developed in Processing (compatible with 3.x) and relies heavily on the following libraries:
* **ControlP5:** Almost all GUI elements, separate windows for GUI and Canvas
* **PeasyCam:** 3D Canvas with interactions for zoom, pan and rotate
* **TheMidiBus:** Midi library for physical controllers (mostly Korg NanoKontrol 2)
* **Syphon/Spout:** Frame sharing for preview window and broadcasting to compatible software such as Resolume
* **Minim:** Interfacing with Microphone input and calculating FFT
* **OscP5:** Controlling parameters via network (experimental)
